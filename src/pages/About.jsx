        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I'm{" "}
          <span className="text-cyan-500">Mohamed Anouar Alahiane</span>, a
          skilled web developer and UI/UX designer with over six years of
          experience. I specialize in using cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks
          such as React, Next.js, Remix, Vue.js, Astro.js, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for technology and design began years ago, and I have since
          dedicated myself to honing my craft through both formal education and
          hands-on experience. I have had the privilege of working on a wide
          range of projects, from small-scale startups to large-scale enterprise
          applications, always striving to deliver high-quality results.
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise in web development is focused on building dynamic,
          responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using modern JavaScript
          frameworks. I have extensive experience with React, Next.js, and
          Remix, and I am always eager to explore new tools and technologies to
          stay ahead of the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong background in
          UI/UX design, with a focus on creating visually appealing and engaging
          user interfaces. I am adept at using design tools such as Figma and
          Sketch to create wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs that
          exceed clients' expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also well-versed in digital marketing, including SEO, social
          media marketing, and email marketing. This knowledge allows me to take
          a holistic approach to my projects, ensuring that all aspects of a
          client's digital presence are optimized for success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have built a reputation for being a
          collaborative and communicative team player, always willing to go the
          extra mile to ensure client satisfaction. My strong adaptability and
          problem-solving skills enable me to navigate challenging situations
          with ease, delivering innovative and effective solutions.
        </p>
